# 🔐 Caesar Cipher - Python Implementation

## 📌 Task 01: Implement Caesar Cipher

This project is part of my cybersecurity internship, where I was assigned to build a basic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool using Python.

# 🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?

Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Example:  
- Plaintext: `HELLO`  
- Shift: `3`  
- Encrypted: `KHOOR`


# 🚀 Features

✅ Encrypt messages using Caesar Cipher  
✅ Decrypt messages with a known shift  
✅ Handles uppercase, lowercase, spaces, and punctuation  
✅ Beginner-friendly and interactive terminal UI

# Technologies Used

- Language: **Python 3**
- No external libraries required
- 
# 📄 How to Run

1. *Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher-python.git
   cd caesar-cipher-python
# 2 .Run the python file
   python3 caesar_cipher.py
